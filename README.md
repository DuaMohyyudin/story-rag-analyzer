🌟 What is this project?
This project is like a smart story reader.

You give it a PDF file of a story (like Wish Dragon), and then you can ask questions about that story — just like you'd ask a friend who already read it.

It reads and understands the story using AI, and then gives you smart answers based on what's in the PDF.

📖 What happens step by step?
You start the program.

It looks for a story file (a PDF). If the file is missing, it shows an error and stops.

It opens the PDF and reads all the pages.

Because the story can be long, it breaks it into smaller parts — like cutting a big cake into slices.

It prepares these slices in a way that makes it easier for the computer to understand what they mean. (Like putting them in a memory box that helps the computer find answers later.)

Then, the program tries to start a brain (AI model) that will answer your questions. It tries a strong brain first. If that fails, it uses a smaller one.

🤖 What happens when you ask a question?
You type something like:
“Who is the dragon?”

The program looks through the story slices and finds the 3 most related parts.

It shows those 3 parts to the AI brain and says:
“Here’s the context — now answer the question!”

The AI reads those parts and writes a smart answer.

You see the answer on your screen.

🧠 What if the AI brain doesn’t work?
If the main smart brain (called "Ollama") isn’t installed or available, the program uses a smaller brain (called "Zephyr") instead.

It’s not as powerful, but it can still understand and answer simple questions.

The program tells you if it's using the smaller brain and even shows you how to get the better one.

💬 What kind of questions can you ask?
Anything related to the story in the PDF, such as:

Who is the main character?

What is the plot of the story?

How does the story end?

What are the powers of the dragon?

🛑 How do you stop it?
Just type exit and it will quit.
